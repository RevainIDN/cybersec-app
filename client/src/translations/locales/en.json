				"question1": "What is considered a strong password?",
				"answer1": "A strong password should be long, at least 12 characters (ideally 16 or more). It should include both uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters like @, #, $, %. It’s important that the password doesn't contain easily guessable combinations, such as names, birthdates, or common phrases like '123456' or 'password'. These passwords are easy to crack.",
				"question2": "Is it okay to use the same password for all accounts?",
				"answer2": "Using the same password for all accounts is a huge security risk. If one account is compromised, an attacker can easily access your other accounts as well. To protect your data, it’s important to use unique passwords for each service, and consider using a password manager to securely store and manage them.",
				"question3": "How can I remember all my passwords?",
				"answer3": "The best way to remember all your passwords is to use password managers like Bitwarden, 1Password, or KeePass. These tools help securely store and generate strong passwords for each service. If you prefer to write passwords down manually, make sure to protect them with a password or store them in encrypted files. It's not recommended to keep passwords in unprotected notes or documents.",
				"question4": "How often should I change my password?",
				"answer4": "If your password is long, complex, and unique, you don’t need to change it unless there has been a data breach or suspicious activity. However, if the service recommends a password change or if you’re notified of a potential data breach, you should change it immediately. Regularly updating your passwords helps increase your security."
